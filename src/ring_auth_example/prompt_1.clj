(ns ring-auth-example.prompt-1)

;; Ring is a library that we use to represent http requests and responses in
;; clojure data structures. I think of it as a `wrapper`, that wraps incoming
;; requests with a transformation -- http->clj, and wraps outgoing requests with
;; the transformation clj->http

;; Generate a ring request: a HTTP GET to endpoint "/". Use ring.mock.request

;; To unlock the next part of the exercise, decrypt second_prompt.clj with 
;;  the request you generated
