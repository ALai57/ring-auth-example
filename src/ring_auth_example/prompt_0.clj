  ;; Start here when you're ready

  ;; All the prompts in this workshop are encrypted. To move on to subsequent
  ;;  challenges, you'll need to solve the puzzle and decrypt the next file

  ;; The first challenge is to decrypt the file:
  ;;  src/ring_auth_example/prompt_1.clj.encrypted

  ;; Use the tools in the workspace to decrypt the problem and get started!
  ;; README.me has advice for how to get started =)
